# CodeAlpha_ML_Credit-Scoring-Model_Task-01

Credit Scoring Model
Overview
This project predicts the creditworthiness of individuals using their financial history. We’ve used several machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest to compare their accuracy in predicting credit scores.

How to Use
Install Python: Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
Open Jupyter Notebook: Open the credit_scoring_model.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the Steps: Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the models.
Experiment: Try different models and settings to improve the results.
Model Results
Here’s how accurate each model is:
